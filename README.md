Connecting You to the Heart of Nature
integrating with Bhuvan API for agricultural satellite data and building an AI-based prediction model is feasible. Hereâ€™s a high-level approach:

Bhuvan API Integration

Check the API documentation for authentication, endpoints, and data retrieval methods.
Identify available layers for agriculture, such as soil moisture, crop classification, and vegetation indices.
Fetch and preprocess the satellite images and GIS data.
Data Processing & Feature Engineering

Apply image processing techniques (NDVI, EVI) to extract meaningful agricultural insights.
Use geospatial libraries like GDAL, GeoPandas, and Rasterio for handling satellite data.
Incorporate weather, soil, and historical yield data for better predictions.
AI-Based Prediction Model

Choose models like CNNs (for image analysis), LSTMs (for time-series forecasting), or Random Forest (for classification).
Train the model on labeled agricultural datasets for yield prediction, soil health analysis, or crop classification.
Fine-tune the model with real-time satellite data updates.
Application Development

Develop a web or mobile dashboard for farmers/agri-businesses to visualize predictions.
Implement geospatial mapping for real-time insights.
Provide recommendations for crop selection, irrigation, and fertilizer use.
Challenges & Considerations

API limitations: Check for data refresh frequency and resolution constraints.
Data privacy & regulatory compliance.
Cloud infrastructure for processing and storing large datasets.
